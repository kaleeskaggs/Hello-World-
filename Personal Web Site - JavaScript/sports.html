	<p> <ol>I play softball and volleyball!
	<li>I love softball</li>
	<li>I've played softball for 12 years</li>
	<li>I hit lots of homeruns</li>
	<li>I play centerfield</li>
	<li>I'm number 3</li>
	<li>I've got lots of Region and District awards</li>
	<li>I play softball year round because of travel ball</li>
	</ol></p>
	
	<p><ol>Volleyball sucks
	<li>I have played volleyball for 4 years</li>
	<li>My freshmen through junior year was alright</li>
	<li>My senior season made me wanna kill myself</li>
	<li>My coach hated me but the feeling was mutural</li>
	<li>I am very happy that volleyball is over!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I have played softball for a long time. I have played on many different teams. I have played leauge ball, travel ball, middle school, and highschool softball. I have won many different awards. I have got distrct and region awards. I have also broke a school record. My team also broke another record last year. </p>
	<p>Softball is the only sport that has ever won a state championship in our highschool. We won the state championship in 2011. That season we went 44-4. Most of the players had all played travel ball together all of their lives so they were very used to playing together and they were very good.</p>
	<p>Volleyball has never been very good at our school. We have never won a district championship and we have never won a game in the first round of region. I do not like this sport anymore. Im very glad it is over.</p></strong>
